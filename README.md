## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building and Running Production Server

```bash

## Update to your Project

A few things should be updated to your specific project. 
1. Replace all instantances of `_REACT_REDUX_SSR_BOILERPLATE` to a cookie of your choosing.
2. Change the redux modules from `react-boilerplate/auth/LOAD` to `{PROJECT_NAME}/auth/LOAD`.
3. Set all your meta data in `config.js`
4. Consider adding GA with [React GA](https://github.com/react-ga/react-ga) or [GTM](https://github.com/holidaycheck/react-google-tag-manager) (haven't tested the GTM one yet)

#### Redux Middleware

The middleware, [`clientMiddleware.js`](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example/blob/master/src/redux/middleware/clientMiddleware.js), serves two functions:

1. To allow the action creators access to the client API facade. Remember this is the same on both the client and the server, and cannot simply be `import`ed because it holds the cookie needed to maintain session on server-to-server requests.
2. To allow some actions to pass a "promise generator", a function that takes the API client and returns a promise. Such actions require three action types, the `REQUEST` action that initiates the data loading, and a `SUCCESS` and `FAILURE` action that will be fired depending on the result of the promise. There are other ways to accomplish this, some discussed [here](https://github.com/rackt/redux/issues/99), which you may prefer, but to the author of this example, the middleware way feels cleanest.

#### Styles

This project uses [local styles](https://medium.com/seek-ui-engineering/the-end-of-global-css-90d2a4a06284) using [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader). The way it works is that you import your stylesheet at the top of the `render()` function in your React Component, and then you use the classnames returned from that import. Like so:

```javascript
render() {
const styles = require('./App.scss');
...
```

Then you set the `className` of your element to match one of the CSS classes in your SCSS file, and you're good to go!

```jsx
<div className={styles.mySection}> ... </div>
```

#### Alternative to Local Styles

If you'd like to use plain inline styles this is possible with a few modifications to your webpack configuration.

**1. Configure Isomorphic Tools to Accept CSS**

In `webpack-isomorphic-tools.js` add **css** to the list of style module extensions

```javascript
    style_modules: {
      extensions: ['less','scss','css'],
```

**2. Add a CSS loader to webpack dev config**

In `dev.config.js` modify **module loaders** to include a test and loader for css

```javascript
  module: {
    loaders: [
      { test: /\.css$/, loader: 'style-loader!css-loader'},
```

**3. Add a CSS loader to the webpack prod config**

You must use the **ExtractTextPlugin** in this loader. In `prod.config.js` modify **module loaders** to include a test and loader for css

```javascript
  module: {
    loaders: [
      { test: /\.css$/, loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract('style-loader', 'css-loader')},
```

**Now you may simply omit assigning the `required` stylesheet to a variable and keep it at the top of your `render()` function.**

```javascript
render() {
require('./App.css');
require('aModule/dist/style.css');
...
```

**NOTE** In order to use this method with **scss or less** files one more modification must be made. In both `dev.config.js` and `prod.config.js` in the loaders for less and scss files remove 

1. `modules`
2. `localIdentName...`

Before:
```javascript
{ test: /\.less$/, loader: 'style!css?modules&importLoaders=2&sourceMap&localIdentName=[local]___[hash:base64:5]!autoprefixer?browsers=last 2 version!less?outputStyle=expanded&sourceMap' },
```
After:
```javascript
{ test: /\.less$/, loader: 'style!css?importLoaders=2&sourceMap!autoprefixer?browsers=last 2 version!less?outputStyle=expanded&sourceMap' },
```

After this modification to both loaders you will be able to use scss and less files in the same way as css files.

#### Unit Tests

The project uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) to run your unit tests, it uses [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) as the test runner, it enables the feature that you are able to render your tests to the browser (e.g: Firefox, Chrome etc.), which means you are able to use the [Test Utilities](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html) from Facebook api like `renderIntoDocument()`.

To run the tests in the project, just simply run `npm test` if you have `Chrome` installed, it will be automatically launched as a test service for you.

To keep watching your test suites that you are working on, just set `singleRun: false` in the `karma.conf.js` file. Please be sure set it to `true` if you are running `npm test` on a continuous integration server (travis-ci, etc).

## Deployment on Heroku

To get this project to work on Heroku, you need to:

1. Remove the `"PORT": 8080` line from the `betterScripts` / `start-prod` section of `package.json`.
2. `heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production`
3. `heroku config:set NODE_PATH=./src`
4. `heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false`
  * This is to enable webpack to run the build on deploy.

The first deploy might take a while, but after that your `node_modules` dir should be cached.
